<h4><i>Do you have any ideas on how students with student loan debts and unaffordable college tuitions can be helped? </i><h/4>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>No</li>
  <li>No. I just hope to become a millionaire and pay my parents back one day.</li>
  <li>More grants from the government and the university.</li>
  <li>Yes, but we'd have to redo the entire education system!</li>
  <li>Signing up for as many scholarships as possible. Working while in school. Taking out federal loans. Taking out loans from family. Making responsible financial choices.</li>
  <li>Expensive tuition stems from the internal structure of private colleges. In-state college is a much more affordable option for a student. Private colleges are allowed to have more expensive tuition for various reasons - larger campuses, better professors, prestige, etc - that's where a college student gets fucked</li>
